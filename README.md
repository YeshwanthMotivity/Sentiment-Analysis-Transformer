# Sentiment-Analysis-Transformer

📊 Sentiment-Analysis-Transformer
Sentiment-Analysis-Transformer is a machine learning project that performs sentiment analysis on text data using a Transformer-based model. It classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments with high accuracy using pre-trained language models and custom training on Parquet datasets.

🚀 Features
Uses Hugging Face Transformers for easy model loading and fine-tuning.
Efficient Parquet dataset handling using Pandas and Hugging Face Datasets.
AutoModelForSequenceClassification enables sentiment prediction.
Lightweight and optimized for local execution.
Adaptable for any text classification use case.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Transformers – Pre-trained models and tokenizers (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT)
Hugging Face Datasets – For loading and managing Parquet datasets
PyTorch (torch) – Backend for training and inference
Pandas – For data manipulation and Parquet file support
Jupyter Notebook – Development and experimentation


📄 How It Works
Load a Parquet file containing text and sentiment labels.
Convert data into a Hugging Face Dataset.
Tokenize text using AutoTokenizer.
Fine-tune a transformer model with AutoModelForSequenceClassification.
Train using the Trainer API.
Predict sentiment on new text inputs.

💻 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YeshwanthMotivity/Sentiment-Analysis-Transformer.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Transformer
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook:
Open Sentiment.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells step by step for training and predictions.

📈 Future Scope
Deploy using Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI for real-time analysis.
Extend to multi-label sentiment (e.g., joy, anger, surprise).
Enable live data input from web forms or chatbots.
